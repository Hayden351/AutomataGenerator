A state machine is a five-tuple
1) a set of states 
2) an initial state
3) a set of final states
4) a set of characters that denote an input alphabet
5) a set of transitions that map a set of states and a set of
   characters to a set of states

Auxiliary component
A map from state numbers to enumerated type values


A state machine definition and an int to enum map is sufficient to define a
state machine




12/11/2017: i'm not sure if it makes sense to have a set of states
            be a set of sets.
